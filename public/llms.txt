# OpenClaw Trace
> See what your agents are actually doing.

## What it does
OpenClaw Trace is a free, open-source observability dashboard for OpenClaw multi-agent systems. It provides real-time monitoring of agent execution traces, token consumption, costs, and performance. Users can drill into individual heartbeats, compare runs side-by-side, set budget limits, and access all metrics via REST API. Runs with a single command: npx openclaw-trace.
